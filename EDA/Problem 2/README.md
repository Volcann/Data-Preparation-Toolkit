### 🌸 Univariate Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Iris Dataset

Univariate analysis involves examining each variable in the dataset individually. This analysis helps understand the basic structure and distribution of the data. In the Iris dataset, we focus on the following key variables:

1. **Sepal Length**: Distribution of sepal length
   - **📊 Summary**: We calculate measures such as mean, median, and standard deviation of sepal length.
   - **📈 Visualization**: A histogram or kernel density plot displays the distribution of sepal length.

2. **Sepal Width**: Distribution of sepal width
   - **📊 Summary**: We calculate measures such as mean, median, and standard deviation of sepal width.
   - **📈 Visualization**: A histogram or kernel density plot displays the distribution of sepal width.

3. **Petal Length**: Distribution of petal length
   - **📊 Summary**: We calculate measures such as mean, median, and standard deviation of petal length.
   - **📈 Visualization**: A histogram or kernel density plot displays the distribution of petal length.

4. **Petal Width**: Distribution of petal width
   - **📊 Summary**: We calculate measures such as mean, median, and standard deviation of petal width.
   - **📈 Visualization**: A histogram or kernel density plot displays the distribution of petal width.

5. **Species**: Distribution of species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)
   - **📊 Summary**: We count the number of instances of each species.
   - **📈 Visualization**: A bar chart illustrates the frequency of each species.

### 🌐 Multivariate Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Iris Dataset

Multivariate analysis examines relationships between two or more variables simultaneously. This analysis helps understand interactions and dependencies between variables in the Iris dataset:

1. **Sepal Length vs. Sepal Width**
   - **🔍 Analysis**: We examine the relationship between sepal length and sepal width.
   - **📊 Visualization**: A scatter plot shows the relationship between sepal length and sepal width, potentially with different colors for each species.

2. **Petal Length vs. Petal Width**
   - **🔍 Analysis**: We investigate the relationship between petal length and petal width.
   - **📊 Visualization**: A scatter plot shows the relationship between petal length and petal width, potentially with different colors for each species.

3. **Sepal Length vs. Petal Length**
   - **🔍 Analysis**: We explore the relationship between sepal length and petal length.
   - **📊 Visualization**: A scatter plot displays the relationship between sepal length and petal length, potentially with different colors for each species.

4. **Sepal Width vs. Petal Width**
   - **🔍 Analysis**: We analyze the relationship between sepal width and petal width.
   - **📊 Visualization**: A scatter plot shows the relationship between sepal width and petal width, potentially with different colors for each species.

5. **Pair Plot**
   - **🔍 Analysis**: We create a pair plot to visualize the relationships between all pairs of numerical variables.
   - **📊 Visualization**: A pair plot provides scatter plots for each pair of variables, with different colors for each species.

### 🔗 Correlation Analysis on Iris Dataset

Correlation analysis involves examining the relationships between numerical variables to understand how they change together. For the Iris dataset, we focus on:

   - **📊 Visualization**: A heatmap displays the correlation matrix, highlighting strong and weak correlations.

2. **Sepal Length and Petal Length Correlation**
   - **🔍 Analysis**: We investigate the correlation between sepal length and petal length to see how these variables are related.
   - **📊 Visualization**: A scatter plot shows the relationship between sepal length and petal length, potentially with a trend line.

3. **Sepal Width and Petal Width Correlation**
   - **🔍 Analysis**: We explore the relationship between sepal width and petal width.
   - **📊 Visualization**: A scatter plot displays the correlation between sepal width and petal width.
